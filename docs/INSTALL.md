# Installing FlowSight

Every release ships the same daemon for four platforms and three package
formats. Pick yours; the [Getting started](GETTING-STARTED.md) chapter
continues from the first login.

| Platform | Package | Service | Config | Data | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OPNsense (amd64, aarch64) | `os-flowsight-<ver>-<arch>.pkg` | `service flowsight` | `/usr/local/etc/flowsight` | `/var/db/flowsight` | `/usr/local/share/flowsight/docs` |
| FreeBSD | `install.sh` or the raw binary | rc script | `/usr/local/etc/flowsight` | `/var/db/flowsight` | (manual on the release page) |
| Debian, Ubuntu (amd64, arm64) | `flowsight_<ver>_<arch>.deb` | `systemctl … flowsight` | `/etc/flowsight` | `/var/lib/flowsight` | `/usr/share/doc/flowsight` |
| RHEL, Rocky, Alma, Fedora (x86_64, aarch64) | `flowsight-<ver>-1.<arch>.rpm` | `systemctl … flowsight` | `/etc/flowsight` | `/var/lib/flowsight` | `/usr/share/doc/flowsight` |

Releases: <https://github.com/grioghar/flowsight/releases>. Every asset is
listed in `SHA256SUMS`; the binaries are additionally signed and verified by
the in-place updater.

## OPNsense

1. Install `os-ntopng` from System › Firmware › Plugins (recommended; it
   provides application identification). Leave the OPNsense proxy plugin
   (`os-squid`) without transparent interception on the networks FlowSight
   will intercept, or uninstall it: FlowSight runs its own squid instance.
2. Install the package:

   ```sh
   fetch https://github.com/grioghar/flowsight/releases/latest/download/os-flowsight-amd64.pkg
   pkg add os-flowsight-amd64.pkg
   ```

   (`os-flowsight-aarch64.pkg` on ARM.) The post-install script enables the
   service, registers the pf anchors and reloads the filter. **FlowSight**
   appears as its own section in the left-hand menu.
3. First run: the Overview shows hosts and flows within a minute. Under
   *Settings › visibility* the daemon has created its own ntopng account; no
   ntopng login is needed. Category feeds download in the background (a few
   minutes; roughly six million domains).
4. Web interception: *Settings › web › Intercept web traffic*. From then on
   every web session carries its server name and web policies can block.
5. Policies: create groups and policies, look at the plan, then turn on
   *Settings › policy › Enforce policy*. Until then nothing is written to any
   backend.
6. TLS inspection (Pro): *TLS › Create inspection CA*, download the
   certificate, install it as a trusted root on the devices you intend to
   inspect, and turn inspection on in their policy with a bypass list for
   banking and pinned applications.

Upgrading: FlowSight › Updates installs new releases in place; `pkg add -f`
with a newer package does the same and also refreshes the plugin files and
the documentation.

Uninstalling (`pkg delete os-flowsight`) stops the service, withdraws the
interception and policy rules, removes the resolver includes and reloads the
resolver and filter. The store under `/var/db/flowsight` and the policy under
`/usr/local/etc/flowsight` are kept.

## Debian and Ubuntu

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/grioghar/flowsight/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

or `apt install ./flowsight_<version>_<arch>.deb`. The installer writes
`/etc/flowsight/flowsight.json` with a generated API token (printed once)
and starts the `flowsight` unit. The UI is on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`; sign
in with the token. To expose it on a LAN set `"bind"` in the config file
(the token protects it) or put it behind a reverse proxy.

## RHEL, Rocky, Alma, Fedora

```sh
dnf install ./flowsight-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm     # or .aarch64.rpm
```

Same layout and behaviour as the Debian package. The RPM is built with
`packaging/rpm/build-rpm.sh` and depends on `unbound`; squid, ntopng and
Suricata are recommended, not required.

Backends on Linux are found where the distribution keeps them (Unbound in
`/etc/unbound`, squid in `/etc/squid`, Suricata's EVE log in
`/var/log/suricata`). Paths can be overridden under `"paths"` in the config.
On Linux the pf providers are unavailable: DNS policy, visibility, reports
and alerting work; web and application enforcement wait for nftables
providers.

## FreeBSD (not OPNsense)

The same installer works. Add to `pf.conf`:

```
nat-anchor "flowsight/*"
rdr-anchor "flowsight/*"
anchor "flowsight/*" quick
```

and reload pf. The firewall module reports a finding until the anchor is
referenced.

## Configuration file

`flowsight.json` holds only what you change; every key has a default. The
complete list is in the [Configuration reference](CONFIGURATION.md).

```json
{
  "site_name": "Home",
  "bind": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8080,
  "api_token": "",
  "retention": { "flows_days": 7, "dns_days": 7, "alerts_days": 30, "rollup_days": 400 },
  "modules": {
    "web": { "intercept": true, "networks": ["10.0.0.0/24"] },
    "policy": { "enforce": true },
    "enrich": { "reverse_dns": true, "geoip": true },
    "ui": { "theme": "auto" }
  }
}
```

`bind`, `port`, `api_token`, `data_dir` and `paths` can only be changed in
this file, never through the API: whoever can change where the daemon listens
is root, and the API is not.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/grioghar/flowsight && cd flowsight
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=freebsd GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w -X main.Version=1.0.0" -o flowsightd ./cmd/flowsightd
packaging/freebsd/build-pkg.sh 1.0.0 amd64 ./flowsightd plugin/os-flowsight/src ./dist          # on FreeBSD (needs pkg)
packaging/debian/build-deb.sh 1.0.0 amd64 ./flowsightd-linux ./dist                            # needs dpkg-deb

```

Go 1.24 or newer, no cgo, no other toolchain. A build from source carries
no release keys: it cannot verify updates or licenses and runs Community
(see [Security](SECURITY.md)).
