# API reference

FlowSight is driven entirely through a JSON HTTP API; the UI uses nothing else. On OPNsense the GUI page proxies it at `/flowsight.php?api=<path>` with the session's CSRF token; on other systems it listens at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default.

## API Explorer

An interactive OpenAPI explorer is built into FlowSight at the **API** page under Administration. It provides:
- Grouped operations by area (Monitor, Inventory, Protect, Administration)
- Parameter and request body templates
- Live request/response with timing
- Copy as curl for easy CLI testing

Download the full OpenAPI 3.0 specification at `GET /api/openapi.json` for use with Swagger UI, Insomnia, Postman, or other tools.

## Conventions

- Every write (POST) needs the header `X-Requested-With: Flowsight`. From anything that is not the OPNsense GUI or loopback, also send the API token in `X-Flowsight-Token` (or sign in once at `POST /api/login` with `{"token": …}` to get a session cookie).
- Responses are JSON objects. Errors are `{"error": "message"}` with a matching status: 400 invalid input, 402 the feature needs a higher license tier or the license has expired (`locked` or `expired` is set, with `feature` and `required`), 403 forbidden (missing header, read-only instance, locked key), 404 unknown route, 500 a backend failed.
- Time windows take `hours` (default 24). Lists take `limit`.
- The machine-readable description is at `GET /api/openapi.json`.
- Every write is recorded in the audit log (`GET /api/system/audit`) with the user and client address.

## Authentication

The API accepts authentication in three ways:

1. **Token header**: Send `X-Flowsight-Token: your-api-token` with every request.
2. **Bearer token**: Send `Authorization: Bearer your-api-token` with every request.
3. **Session cookie**: POST `{"token": "your-api-token"}` to `/api/login` to receive an `fs_session` cookie.

Loopback clients (127.0.0.1, ::1) without a token configured are trusted.

## Common parameters

Many endpoints accept query parameters to control scope and pagination:
- `hours`: Time window in hours (default varies by endpoint; max 9600 hours).
- `minutes`: Time window in minutes (alternative to hours).
- `limit`: Maximum number of records to return (default 100; max 10000).
- `offset`: Pagination offset for large result sets.

## Response format

All responses are JSON. Successful requests return the requested data. Errors return:

```json
{"error": "error message"}
```

Status codes:
- `200` OK
- `400` Bad request (invalid input or missing required field)
- `402` License tier or feature required, or license expired
- `403` Forbidden (insufficient permissions, read-only instance, or missing header)
- `404` Not found
- `500` Internal server error
