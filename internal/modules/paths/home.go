// Where "here" is.
//
// The map needs an origin for two reasons. It is the point every route leaves
// from, and it is the reference for the only check that can falsify a
// placement: light in fibre covers about 200,000 km per second, so a round
// trip cannot beat twice the straight-line distance divided by that, before
// any routing detour or equipment delay is added. A hop that answers faster
// than that floor is not in the place the database says it is.
//
// Left alone, "here" is worked out from the gateway's own public address. That
// is usually the right town and occasionally the wrong state, because it is
// where the carrier registered the block rather than where the wire ends. So
// it can be declared instead, and the page offers two ways to fill it in: ask
// the browser, which knows precisely and asks permission, or take the
// database's answer for the public address.
