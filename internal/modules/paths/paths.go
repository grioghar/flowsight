// Package paths answers a question the rest of FlowSight cannot: not what
// left the network, but which way it went.
//
// Everything else here watches the first hop. A flow record says a device
// reached an address; it says nothing about the fifteen routers in between,
// whose country, carrier and latency decide whether a connection is fast,
// legal, and going where you think it is.
//
// So this traces the destinations the network actually talks to, drawn from
// the history rather than probed at large, and keeps what it finds. A path
// belongs to a destination, not to a device: everything leaves through the
// same gateway, so the route from here to a given address is the same
// whichever device asked for it. A device is linked to a path because it has
// flows to that destination, which is a join rather than another trace.
//
// What this is not: a map of where packets physically are. Intermediate
// routers geolocate badly, often to wherever their address block was
// registered, and a single trace is one sample of a path that varies per
// flow. Every hop carries where its location came from, so a reader can tell
// a measured answer from a registrar's guess.
